"""Cross-encoder reranking — the precision stage of retrieval (Phase 5, Step 3).

RRF fusion (in `retrieval.py`) is a good *candidate generator* but a blunt ranker:
it scores a fact by where it placed in each source's list, not by whether it
actually answers the query. So a short, generic fact ("moodump is a journaling
companion") or a thesis's front-matter ("dedicated to my parents") can outrank
the fact the user wants.

A cross-encoder fixes that: it reads the query and a candidate fact **together**
and scores their relevance directly. We run it over the merged top-N candidates
and reorder, keeping the top-k. The model (`BAAI/bge-reranker-base`, CPU) is a
thread-safe lazy singleton; `_score` is the single compute seam, so tests stub it
and never download the weights — mirroring `embeddings.py`.
